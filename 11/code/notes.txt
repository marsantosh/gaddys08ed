# On static members of classes
The `this` pointer cannot be used in a static member function, because
static member functions are not called through any instance of their class.
Moreover, a static member function acannot access an instance member
of its class unless it specifies what instance the member belongs to.

An advantage of static member functions is they can be called before any instances of the
class have been created. This allows them to be used to perform complex initialization
tasks that have to be done before objects of the class have been created.


# Friends of Classes:
# Concept:
A friend is a function that is not a member of a class, but has 
acces to the private members of the class.

# On static members of classes
The `this` pointer cannot be used in a static member function, because
static member functions are not called through any instance of their class.
Moreover, a static member function acannot access an instance member
of its class unless it specifies what instance the member belongs to.

An advantage of static member functions is they can be called before any instances of the
class have been created. This allows them to be used to perform complex initialization
tasks that have to be done before objects of the class have been created.

# Friends of Classes:
# Concept:
A friend is a function that is not a member of a class, but has 
acces to the private members of the class.



#
# Memberwise Assignment
The = operator may be used to assign one object to another, or to initialize
one object with another objectâ€™s data. By default, each member of one
object is copied to its counterpart in the other object.



#
# Copy Constructors
A copy constructor is a special constructor that is called
whenever a new object is created and initialized with the data of 
another object of the same class.
If the programmer does not specify a copy constructor for the class, then the compiler
automatically calls a default copy constructor. This default copy constructor simply copies
the data of the existing object to the new object using memberwise assignment.

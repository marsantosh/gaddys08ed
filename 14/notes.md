#                           __Recursion__
A Recursive function is one that calls itself.

To be useful, a recursive function must have a way of controlling the number
of recursive calls. 

Recursive functions work by breaking a complex problem down into
subproblems of the same type. This breaking down process stops when it reaches
a _base case_, that is, a subproblem that is a simple enoigh to be solved
directly.

One should consider the use of recursion when there is a way to express the
solution of a problem in terms of solutions of simpler or smaller problems 
of the same type.

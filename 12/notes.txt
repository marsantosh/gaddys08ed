#                               C-String
A C-string is a sequence of characters stored in consecutive memory
locations and terminated by a null character.
The type of a C-string is ` char * ` that is, the type of a C-string is pointer to char.
C-strings can be represented as string literals or as arrays of characters.
Both of these methods allocate an array and then use the address of the array as a pointer
to char to actually represent the string. The difference between the two is that in the first
case, the array used to store the string is allocated implicitly by the compiler, whereas in the
second, the array is explicitly allocated by the programmer.
The third method of representing a C-string uses a pointer to char to point to a C-string
whose storage has already been allocated by one of the other two methods.
A major advantage in using a pointer variable to represent a C-string is the ability to make
the pointer point to different C-strings.
Another way to use a pointer to a char as a C-string is to define the pointer and then set it
to point to dynamically allocated storage returned by the new operator.

#                   Using Pointers to Pass C-String Arguments
Pointers are extremely useful for writing functions that process C-strings. If the starting
address of a string is passed into a pointer parameter variable, it can be assumed that all
the characters, from that address up to the byte that holds the null terminator are part of
the string. (It isnâ€™t necessary to know the length of the array that holds the string.)
